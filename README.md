# To Grow a Backbone
This is a package for the tutorial of 'To Grow a Backbone' lecture.

## Installation
1. Install pytorch according to the instructions in this [link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2. Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Before the Lecture
1. Download an IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). There are pro and cons for both, but in general I found that Pycharm is easier to getting start with, but lack some important features unless you use the Professional version (features like remote interpreter or jupyter notebook).
2. Install this package.
3. See that you are able to run the pytorch tutorial:
    * If you are working in VSCode or Pycharm professional you should be able to run the notebook file in **exercises\pytorch_classification_tutorial.ipynb**.
    * If you are using the community version of pycharm, run the python script in **exercises\pytorch_classification_tutorial.py**.

## Recommended (Optional)
1. Go through the full [Pytorch classification tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).
2. Read about **python packages** and **setup.py** file (it is a recommended way to code, which helps avoid imports problems).
